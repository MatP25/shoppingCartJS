                    Hi! My name is Mat√≠as and this is one of the projects I've been working on as part of my journey learning JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to starting this project I had been learning the fundamentals of JavaScript for a month or so but only applying that knowledge in small and isolated problems or exercises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This made want to start a project a little bigger where I could force myself to learn new things, integrate several JS concepts at once and practice my HTML and CSS skills at the same time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I had started a new JS course in <a href="https://www.coderhouse.com/" target="_blank">CODERHOUSE</a> and I had to make a final project as a requirement, I thought it would be a great opportunity to push myself to make something I would be proud of, though I know there's plenty of room for improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I was able to learn a lot while working on this project, considering, for instance, that I had absolutely no idea how things such as Promises, Event Delegation, reading JSON files or browser storage worked (at all!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I must admit I wouldn't have made this project without referencing some tutorials and of course some guidance from the teacher and tutors in CoderHouse. 
                    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-a-shopping-cart-with-javascript/" target="_blank" title="Shopping Cart in Javascript tutorial">This freeCodeCamp tutorial</a> helped me tremendously on getting started and it was fun to expand on it as I learned new things.
                </p>
