      "description":"Bayer K9 Advantix® II controls fleas, ticks and lice on dogs within one day of treatment and will continue to protect the dog from further flea, tick and lice infestations for at least four weeks. K9 Advantix® II also reduces biting by mosquitoes and stable flies; and kills mosquitoes. K9 Advantix® II is applied to the skin down the back of the dog. From there, it spreads evenly as a thin layer over the skin surface and is locked in the oils of the dog's skin rather than being absorbed internally. When parasites such as fleas, ticks, mosquitoes and lice come in contact with the skin of a treated dog, the parasites' nervous system becomes affected. The parasites quickly become uncoordinated and die. K9 Advantix® II works through contact and does not require the pest to start feeding on your pet in order to be killed. Reducing biting keeps pets comfortable and can help to prevent disease transmission.",
