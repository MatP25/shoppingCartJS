From there, it spreads evenly as a thin layer over the skin surface and is locked in the oils of the dog's skin rather than being absorbed internally. When parasites such as fleas, ticks, mosquitoes and lice come in contact with the skin of a treated dog, the parasites' nervous system becomes affected. The parasites quickly become uncoordinated and die. K9 Advantix® II works through contact and does not require the pest to start feeding on your pet in order to be killed. Reducing biting keeps pets comfortable and can help to prevent disease transmission.",
